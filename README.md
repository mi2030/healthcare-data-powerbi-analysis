## ❓ Project Questions

This project aims to answer the following business and healthcare-related questions:

1. What are the total billing, treatment, and medication costs?
2. Which procedures and departments generate the highest billing amounts?
3. How do billing amounts vary by city across the UK?
4. What is the cost distribution among different types of services (Emergency, Inpatient, Outpatient)?
5. Which diagnoses contribute most to hospital charges?
6. How much is covered by insurance vs. the patient's responsibility?

## ⚙️ Process

### 1. **Data Collection & Structure**
- Imported synthetic healthcare data including multiple tables (visits, patients, procedures, etc.)
- Ensured relationships between fact and dimension tables

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query**
- Handled missing values, standardized column formats, created calculated columns and measures

### 3. **Data Modeling**
- Created relationships between tables (e.g., visits → patients, procedures → departments)
- Applied star schema modeling for optimized performance

### 4. **Visualization in Power BI**
- Created KPI cards for billing, treatment, and cost metrics
- Used bar charts, maps, and stacked bars for deep-dive insights
- Applied filters and slicers for dynamic analysis
